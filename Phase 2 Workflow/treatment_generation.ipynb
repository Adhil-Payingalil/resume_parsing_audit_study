Directed a user-centric redesign using session recordings, live user observation, and interviews to pinpoint major friction areas; introduced data retention, simplified user inputs, and enhanced decision-making, leading to a 25% increase in purchase funnel conversion over 10 months. Achieved a 25% reduction in car insurance inspection time and a 60% decrease in costs by driving the adoption of customer-guided inspections from 20% to 65%, facilitated by usability enhancements like GIF guides, voice navigation, and an improved UI. Streamlined the purchase funnel by setting digital-only policies as the default based on user intent analysis, which decreased requests for printed car insurance policies by 50%, lowered operational expenses, and elevated the customer experience. Introduced a recommendation engine that boosted the profit margin by 12% through a detailed analysis of cost structures and optimization based on user preferences. Established a systematic escalation framework, refined policies for refunds and replacements, and enforced accountability with stores and delivery crews, cutting the complaint resolution time from 9 hours to less than 12 minutes. Engineered new after-sales processes featuring a scalable system for order tracking and escalation to resolve customer issues, resulting in a 25% improvement in NPS.
